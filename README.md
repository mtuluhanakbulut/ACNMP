# ACNMP
Adaptive Conditional Neural Movement Primitives: Skill Transfer and Task Extrapolation through Learning from Demonstration and Reinforcement Learning via Representation Sharing

This directory contains code and simulation files for the experiments.
Questions can be send to [tuluhan_akbulut@brown.edu]

### Requirements:
For simulation:
* Coppelia Simulator. ([https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/)) 
* PyRep ([https://github.com/stepjam/PyRep](https://github.com/stepjam/PyRep))

Required Packages:
* Python 3 
* Numpy
* Scipy
* Scikit-Learn
* Matplotlib
* Tensorflow == 1.14.0
* Tensorflow-Probability == 0.7.0
* Keras == 2.2.5


All 4 experiments can be run from top to bottom using jupyter notebook. You may need to copy .ttt and .ttm files to the folder of Coppelia Robotics for simulation. 

#### The LfD part of the code is taken from https://github.com/myunusseker/CNMP
